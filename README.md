Rules of BlackJack:

[Blackjack is an interactive card game which challenges the player (User) to reach a score of '21' using cards tha represent different varibles. A player is issued 2 cards and then has to determine whether or not to get 'Hit' by the dealer, risking a 'bust'. A bust happens when a player goes over the score. In order to win, a player has to reach the score 21, or et closer to the score 21 without busting. Whoever gets closest to or to the scoe 21 wins that round.]

More Information About Blackjack:

[Blackjack is classically known as a betting game, a parlor and casino game. The game is simple enough for anyone to learn in matter of minutes. In the classic parlor/casino setting blackjack is initiated via a dealer issuing 2 cards out to a minimum of one player and a maximum of 5 players in total (That number includes the dealer). Outside of a casino setting, players typically prefer to rotate dealers around in a clock-wise or counter clock-wise direction. This ensures fairness and transperancy in a game of blackjack. Blackjack is a very fast game because of its simplicity.]

Information on the Back-End Development:

[Blackjack as a game is going to be engineered by Cody Pellom as project one of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive #14. I will utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the JavaScript library known as JQuery. Besides these methods an agile work collaboration will be used along with Trello for userstories, Figma for wireframing and finally the service BitBallon will be used as a host for the local code to be used remotely. Cody Pellom is a thrid week student at General Assembly.]
