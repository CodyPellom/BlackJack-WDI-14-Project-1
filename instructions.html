            Blackjack is an interactive card game which challenges the player (User) to 
            reach a score of '21' using cards that represent different varibles. A player 
            is issued 2 cards and then has to determine whether or not to get 'Hit' by the 
            dealer, risking a 'bust'. A bust happens when a player goes over the score. In
             order to win, a player has to reach the score 21, or et closer to the score 21 
             without busting. Whoever gets closest to or to the score 21 wins that round.
